            <h3> Primary and Secondary school </h3>
            <p>My academic journey started at Selam Children's Village, which has since transformed into Rofam Academy. I spent a formative twelve years there, from elementary school to high school graduation.Rofam Academy was more than just a school; it was my second home for twelve incredible years. I'm proud to say I consistently ranked among the top three students in my class during that time.</p>

            <h3>University</h3>
            <p>AAIT became my second home during my two-year university experience. The 6kilo dormitory was more than just a place to stay; it was a community. I'm excited to continue my coding journey, which began at this wonderful university.</p>
